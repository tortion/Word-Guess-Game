          Here is a bunch of text about someone's random cat.  The cat isn't random, it's anonymous;
          but the owner is missing in action, having gone on vacation for 12 days leaving 12 pounds of
          dry cat food (store brand) and a gallon of contaminated water.  Call Peta.com and let me know
          how it works out.  Being a pet owner is a massive responsibility.  It's all fun and games at
          first, but utlimately, it's a time-suck and a heavy expense.</p>

              <p>Cats are cool but dogs can't hang out.  I have a dog, in fact, I have two dogs (but
                I wish I only had one dog).  My dog, affectionately referred to as "the Gabster" eats 
                better than I do which is to say that she eats a whole food based diet, grain free,
                and packed with 10 essentials.

              <p>The other dog belongs to our oldest daughter, is a puppy, and needs to be traded in
                for a new model; Unfortunately, she <b>is</b> the new model.  But this narrative is about a Cat
                which is to say that it's about me.  All about me.  It's always about me.
